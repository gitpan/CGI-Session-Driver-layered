0.6 -- July 24, 2009

This file was not in the MANIFEST, whoops!

Updated the tests to not use DB_File, which not everyone has.

0.5 -- July 6, 2009

We now keep track of which store has the most recent session, and return
said session.  This way a store can go down and come back up with less
pain.

Made remove() a bit more robust.  It now tries to delete the session from
each driver, regardless of errors encountered along the way.

0.4 -- June 23, 2009

Improved error handling.

0.3 -- June 22, 2009

Many people will have older versions of File::Path, so we much use the older
API in the tests.

0.2 -- June 22, 2009

Changed arguments to be capitalized, better matching CGI::Session's style.

Fixed tests to work on non-unix platforms (hopefully).

0.1 -- June 19, 2009

Intial Release
