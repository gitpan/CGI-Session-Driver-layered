NAME
    CGI::Session::Driver::layered - Use multiple layered drivers

SYNOPSIS
     use CGI::Session;
     
 my $session = CGI::Session->new("driver:layered", $sessionId, { layers => [
       {
         driver    => 'file',
         Directory => '/tmp/foo',
       },
       {
         driver => 'postgresql'
         table  => 'websessions',
         handle => $dbh
       }
     ]});

DESCRIPTION
    CGI::Session::Driver::Layered provides a interface for using multple
    drivers to store sessions. Each session is stored in all the configured
    drivers. When fetching a session, the first driver to return a session
    is used, the drivers being searched in the order they were configured.

OPTIONS
    Unlike most drivers for CGI::Session, this driver requires options to
    function. The driver args must has a layers field, which is an array ref
    of hash references. Each hash reference should contain the driver name
    under the key "driver", and the rest of the arguments for that driver.
    The order of the layers argument is the order that the layer will check
    during a retrieve.
